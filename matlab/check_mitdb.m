% Train & validate the SVM models.
% Maybe use crossvalidation with the train data
%
% Input:
% - window_r_beat: size of signal around each beat (center at R)
% - use_temporal_features: Add RR interval to the feature vector
% - use_morphological_features: Add morphological (wavelet, raw signal)
%                               to the feature vector
% - use_wavelets: use wavelets or raw signal as morphological features
% - norm_features: normalize each feature at beat level (individually) [0,1]
% - svm_type:
%       0 -- C-SVC		(multi-class classification)
%       1 -- nu-SVC		(multi-class classification)
%       2 -- one-class SVM
%       3 -- epsilon-SVR	(regression)
%       4 -- nu-SVR		(regression)
% - kernel_type:
%       0 -- linear: u'*v
%       1 -- polynomial: (gamma*u'*v + coef0)^degree
%       2 -- radial basis function: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2)
%       3 -- sigmoid: tanh(gamma*u'*v + coef0)
%       4 -- precomputed kernel (kernel values in training_instance_matrix)
